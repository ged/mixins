## Description

This is a collection of zero-dependency mixins. They're intended to be generically useful for building other software, well-tested, and not add any non-stdlib dependencies.

The current mixins are:

- Mixins::DataUtilities
- Mixins::Datadir
- Mixins::Delegation
- Mixins::Hooks
- Mixins::Inspection
- Mixins::MethodUtilities


## Prerequisites

* Ruby 3+


## Installation

    $ gem install mixins


## Contributing

You can check out the current development source with Mercurial via its
[project page](https://hg.sr.ht/~ged/Mixins). Or if you prefer Git, via
[its Github mirror](https://github.com/ged/mixins).

After checking out the source, run:

    $ gem install -Ng
    $ rake setup

This will install dependencies, and do any other necessary setup for development.
